The aim of the test is to develop a Javascript application for displaying a list of upcoming Sofar events that can be filtered by genre. You can use any frontend frameworks.

## What the application should do:
 - On initial load, ’All' should be pre-selected, and every show should be displayed
 - Subsequently, if a genre filter is selected, only shows of that genre should be displayed

# Bonus Points
 - We would like to see your journey, so please use your git commits to tell us a story
 - We love TDD so some kind of test suite is a plus. We don't need a full test suite but some tests covering the important logic would be better
 - If you can't achieve everything in the time use the readme to tell us what you would do next.

## Assets
In this repository you will find the assets required to replicated the design attached:

- `./data/shows.json`: A JSON file structured with the data required for the design
- `./img`: The Sofar Sounds logo, a banner image for the header and the arrow icon

Brand
- Typeface: Open Sans
- Brand Colour: #10ad52

_It shouldn’t take more than a couple of hours to complete_
